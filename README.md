## B.O.M.

This is quite a simple schematic, the hardest part was finding exactly what connector they used. I waned it to be plug and play so it needed to be exactly the same one.

JLCPCB Xiaomi Modchip upload

You can see that for around 11 Euro you can have 5 Modchips.  
There is no need to have a black pcb (This just looks nice, I like my PCBA’s to look nice) Also the original PCB is 1mm thick, there is no need to match that (Xiaomi does that for their antenna impedance, We don’t have an antenna anymore)
